Objectives:
•	To create a simple interface for parking system.
•	To make hassle free user friendly parking spaces for customers.
•	Towards a digital step for better tomorrow.

Description in points:
•	Our project deals with the procedure involved in the management of parking of vehicles at a place.  
•	It basically gathers the information of a vehicle and allots a space for it. In case if the owner of the vehicle forgets the exact location of his parked vehicle(suppose in a large parking area), then he can find it out using this program.
•	 After the departure of the vehicle the space is then dynamically allotted to another vehicle.
•	One can also find the total number of vehicles parked at a particular time. 

prerequisites:
1. GNU C compiler
2. Basic Structure and memory allocation concepts.
